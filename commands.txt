GIT-COMMANDS
ls - show the contents of the directory. ls -a will show all hidden files.

pwd - print the Present Working Directory. What directory am I in?

cd - change directory to the one specified. If no directory is specified this will take you to your home directory. Remember that . is the current directory and .. is the parent directory. So cd . changes the directory to the current directory (does nothing!).

cat - print the contents of the file - this will print the the WHOLE file. If you want to stop printing after a full screen use the below command

more - show one screen full of the file (spacebar/Enter moves forward and q stops printing)

head - show the beginning of a file e.g. head -3 shows the first 3 lines of the file

tail - show the end of a file `tail -4 shows the last 4 lines of the file

wc - show the word count of a file (prints lines, words, characters)

CTRL-c - stop what is happening on the command line

CTRL-z - hard stop what is happening on the command line

mkdir - create a new directory

touch - create an empty file

vim

vim is an editor (like notepad on windows) Sometimes it is a little hard to remember all the vim commands so here is a handy cheatsheet: https://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html - with practice it will not seem so odd.

vim <filename> will open a file in vim When you are in vim there are two modes:

Insert mode - in this mode you can enter and change text
Command mode (also called escape mode) - in this mode you can issue commands to vim
When you are in vim a and i will put you in insert mode and esc will take you our of insert mode. If you get stuck in vim press esc esc (yes, twice) and then :q and this will take you back to the shell. Some commands we covered:

a = Go to insert mode

<ESC> :q = quit file

<ESC> :wq = save file and quit vim

<ESC> :q! = exit vim without saving

<ESC> yy = copy current line (the line you are on)

<ESC> p = paste what you last copied
